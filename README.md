# ThesisPythonFiles
This repository contains the Python files created for the data collection and analysis steps of my Master's Thesis for the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, part of the Babes-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca.

The thesis aims to address two fundamental questions. Firstly, it investigates the effect of refactorings on the evolution of these smells, seeking to uncover how the use of refactoring techniques influences the presence and persistence of code and design smells over time. By analyzing the impact of refactorings, this study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these software engineering practices in mitigating or increasing the presence of smells. Secondly, this thesis examines the survival rates of code and design smells, with the purpose of identifying which smells persist the longest and which have relatively shorter lifespans. By analyzing the survival durations of these smells, the research seeks to uncover patterns and characteristics that contribute to their persistence or disappearance. These investigations will not only improve our understanding of the evolution of code and design smells but also provide valuable guidance for developers and maintainers in prioritizing their efforts towards improving software quality and maintenance practices in open-source projects.
